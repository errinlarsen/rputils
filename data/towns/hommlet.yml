    name: PROSPEROUS FARM COTTAGE AND LARGE BARN
    desc: >
      The wood and plaster house is well-kept, and the barn beyond is bulging
      with hay, grain, etc. Several fat animals are about. A large goodwife,
      rosy-cheeked and friendly, greets all who call, while four children look
      on. Inside a young girl and an old granny do various chores. Two large
      farmdogs bark loudly at the approach of strangers. The head of the house
      and two full-grown sons work in the fields. There is nothing to interest
      adventurers here, and outside of feed grain or hay, the farmer does not
      have anything to sell or trade.
